Do not switch storage methods arbitrarily, as this may cause images to become unviewable. \n3. You need to set up domain CORS in the object storage backend, otherwise scenarios like image generation (e.g., poster synthesis) cannot be used. \n4. The image domain of the object storage needs to be added to the WeChat Mini Program official backend as a legal domain for requests and downloadFile."
